## About
This project seeks to identify publications within which the [USGS North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) has been referenced or mentioned. This project uses pre-extracted information available via API from the [GeoDeepDive](https://geodeepdive.org) infrastructure.

## Overview of BBS in records available in the GeoDeepDive database.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## if you open the .rproj you should be in the right directory, otherwise please set it here.
# setwd("path/to/directory/)

# source the R functions
source("R/get_xdd_df.R")


# load packages
  library(ggpubr)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(jsonlite)
  library(rjson)

# plotting themes and settings
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
theme_set(ggpubr::theme_classic2())
```
`r print(getwd())`
```{r bbs_xdd_import_and_munge, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# Import the JSON files and munge into a single data frame ----------------
files <- list.files(here::here("xdd_json"), pattern='.txt', full.names=TRUE)

# import and munge the xdd json into an R df
bbs_xdd <- suppressWarnings(get_xdd_df(files)) # do not turn off suppresswarnings -- there an rmd bug its annoying..
```

We can use various search terms to identify potential uses of the [NABBS](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) data or results in the literature. For example, here we found `r bbs_xdd %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -searchterm, -highlight) %>% n_distinct()` unique publications which used any of the following phrases exactly: 

Exacts earch phrase | Number of unique records in xDD/GDD 
--------------|----
"North American Breeding Bird Survey" | `r bbs_xdd %>% filter(searchterm=="North American Breeding Bird Survey") %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -highlight) %>% n_distinct()` 
"Breeding Bird Survey" |  `r bbs_xdd %>% filter(searchterm=="Breeding Bird Survey") %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -highlight) %>% n_distinct()` 
"NABBS" | `r bbs_xdd %>% filter(searchterm=="NABBS") %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -highlight) %>% n_distinct()` 


```{r pubsvtime, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- bbs_xdd %>% distinct(coveryear, pubname, publisher, title, authors, searchterm)   
ggplot(tmp %>% group_by(searchterm, coveryear) %>% 
         summarise(total_pubs = n()) %>% na.omit() %>% 
         filter(coveryear <= 2022, coveryear >=1980)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=coveryear, y=total_pubs, color=searchterm))+
  scale_color_manual(values=cbPalette)+
  labs(x="year", y="total records")+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), legend.position = "top")
``` 


When we remove the redundancies in the records returned using the abovementioned searches,`r bbs_xdd %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -highlight, -searchterm) %>% n_distinct() + bbs_xdd %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -highlight, -searchterm) %>% filter(is.na(doi))%>% distinct()  %>% nrow() ` remain. 

We can visualize the distribution of  records among unique publishers. Few publications contain the bulk of the records. 
```{r topjrnls, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmp <-  bbs_xdd %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -searchterm) %>% distinct()
tmp <- bind_rows(tmp, bbs_xdd %>% dplyr::select(-filename, -searchterm)%>% filter(is.na(doi)) %>% distinct())

ggplot(tmp %>% group_by(pubname) %>% 
         summarise(n = n())) +
  geom_histogram(aes(n))+
  labs(x="number of publishers", y="total records")
```

Viewing the publications with at least 25 unique records:
```{r topjrnls2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmp <- bbs_xdd %>% distinct(coveryear, pubname, publisher, title, authors, searchterm)%>% group_by(pubname) %>% 
         summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(n >25)   
## the empty pubnames are USGS... so replace
tmp$pubname <- sub("^$", "USGS", tmp$pubname)

ggdotchart(
           tmp, x = "pubname", y = "n",
          rotate = TRUE,
          ylab="number of records", 
          xlab="",
            sorting = "desc", title = "1980-present",
          ggtheme = theme_minimal()
          )
```
